    "## Technical Description\n",
    "After a user logs on, a variety of credentials are generated and stored in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process in memory.\n",
    "This is meant to facilitate single sign-on (SSO) ensuring a user isnâ€™t prompted each time resource access is requested.\n",
    "The credential data may include Kerberos tickets, NTLM password hashes, LM password hashes (if the password is <15 characters, depending on Windows OS version and patch level), and even clear-text passwords (to support WDigest and SSP authentication among others.\n",
    "Adversaries look to get access to the credential data and do it so by finding a way to access the contents of memory of the LSASS process.\n",
    "For example, tools like Mimikatz get credential data by listing all available provider credentials with its SEKURLSA::LogonPasswords module.\n",
    "The module uses a Kernel32 function called OpenProcess to get a handle to lsass to then access LSASS and dump password data for currently logged on (or recently logged on) accounts as well as services running under the context of user credentials.\n",
    "Even though most adversaries might inject into a System process to blend in with most applications accessing LSASS, there are ocassions where adversaries do not elevate to System and use the available administrator rights from the user since that is the minimum requirement to access LSASS."
